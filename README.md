<h3 align="center">A Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic Dataset</h3>

# Titanic-Data-Analysis
Titanic data analysis involves predicting passenger survival based on features like age, class, and gender using machine learning techniques.

# Steps

â€¢ Define the Problem: -----  Understand the objective and what you're trying to solve.

â€¢ Collect Data: -----Gather data from relevant sources (e.g., databases, surveys).

â€¢ Data Cleaning: -----Handle missing values, outliers, and correct errors in the data.

â€¢ Explore Data:----- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and relationships.

â€¢ Feature Engineering: ----Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.

â€¢ Data Visualization: -----Visualize data through graphs and charts to gain insights.

â€¢ Modeling:---- Select and apply appropriate machine learning algorithms or statistical models.

â€¢ Evaluate Models:---- Assess model performance using evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision). 

â€¢ Interpret Results: -----Draw conclusions and make recommendations based on analysis.

1.	Survival Rates by Gender. Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men, with females having a better chance of survival.
   
2.	Survival Rates by Class:  Passengers in first class had the highest survival rates, followed by second and third-class passengers.
	
3.	Age Impact:  Children (younger passengers) had a higher survival rate compared to adults, especially in first class.
	
4.	Embarked Location:  Passengers who boarded the Titanic at Southampton (S) had lower survival rates compared to those from Cherbourg (C) or Queenstown (Q).
	
5.	Pclass vs. Fare:  Passengers in first class paid significantly higher fares, and their survival rates were also higher, reflecting better access to lifeboats and resources.
  
6.	Correlations with Survival:  Variables like gender, class, and age were strong predictors of survival, with passengers in first class, women, and children more likely to survive.

# Deep Insights

1.	61.6% people are died , 38.4% people are alive
  
3.	24% are travell in class 1 , 20% are travell in class 2 , 55% are travell in class 3
